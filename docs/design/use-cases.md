# Use Cases
The AI-CryptoTrader system is designed to provide users with the ability to create and backtest their own trading strategies. The system provides a range of technical indicators and machine learning algorithms for users to choose from, and allows them to combine these in various ways to create custom trading strategies.

Here are some example use cases for the system:

# Use Case 1: Backtesting a Technical Indicator
A user wants to backtest a simple moving average crossover strategy. They select the 'SMA' indicator from the list of available technical indicators, and configure it to use a short-term moving average of 50 periods and a long-term moving average of 200 periods. They then specify the buy and sell signals as follows:

~ Buy Signal: When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average

~ Sell Signal: When the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average
The user then runs a backtest on historical price data for a selected cryptocurrency, and evaluates the performance of the strategy using various metrics such as total return, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown.

# Use Case 2: Combining Technical Indicators and Machine Learning Algorithms
A user wants to create a more complex trading strategy by combining multiple technical indicators and machine learning algorithms. They select the 'MACD' and 'RSI' indicators, and configure them to use default parameters. They then select the 'Random Forest' algorithm and train it on historical price and indicator data for a selected cryptocurrency.

The user then combines the indicator values and machine learning predictions to create custom buy and sell signals as follows:

~ Buy Signal: When both the MACD and RSI indicate a bullish trend, and the Random Forest predicts a positive price change in the next time period.

~ Sell Signal: When either the MACD or RSI indicate a bearish trend, or the Random Forest predicts a negative price change in the next time period.
The user then runs a backtest on historical price data for the selected cryptocurrency, and evaluates the performance of the strategy using various metrics such as total return, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown.

# Use Case 3: Optimizing Trading Strategies
A user wants to optimize their trading strategy by testing various combinations of technical indicators and machine learning algorithms. They use the AI-CryptoTrader system to create a grid search of different parameters for the 'MACD', 'RSI', and 'Random Forest' indicators and algorithms.

The system then automatically tests all possible combinations of parameters, and returns the optimal configuration based on user-defined performance metrics such as total return, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown.

The user then uses the optimal configuration to run a backtest on historical price data for a selected cryptocurrency, and evaluates the performance of the strategy using various metrics.
