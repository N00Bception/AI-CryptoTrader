# Trading Strategies
In this document, we will discuss the various trading strategies employed by the ensemble trading bot.

# Momentum Trading
Momentum trading is a strategy that involves buying assets that have shown an upward trend in price and selling assets that have shown a downward trend in price. This strategy assumes that an asset's upward or downward trend will continue for some time, and that the trader can profit from this trend by buying or selling at the right time.

The ensemble trading bot uses momentum trading by using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators to determine whether an asset is showing an upward or downward trend. The bot will then buy or sell the asset accordingly.

# Mean Reversion Trading
Mean reversion trading is a strategy that involves buying assets that are undervalued and selling assets that are overvalued. This strategy assumes that an asset's price will eventually return to its mean or average value, and that the trader can profit from this by buying or selling at the right time.

The ensemble trading bot uses mean reversion trading by using the Bollinger Bands indicator to determine whether an asset is undervalued or overvalued. The bot will then buy or sell the asset accordingly.

# Breakout Trading
Breakout trading is a strategy that involves buying assets that are breaking out of a range and selling assets that are breaking down from a range. This strategy assumes that an asset's price will continue to move in the direction of the breakout, and that the trader can profit from this by buying or selling at the right time.

The ensemble trading bot uses breakout trading by using the Bollinger Bands and Stochastic Oscillator indicators to determine whether an asset is breaking out of a range or breaking down from a range. The bot will then buy or sell the asset accordingly.

# Trend Following
Trend following is a strategy that involves buying assets that are trending up and selling assets that are trending down. This strategy assumes that an asset's price will continue to move in the direction of the trend, and that the trader can profit from this by buying or selling at the right time.

The ensemble trading bot uses trend following by using the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Gradient Boosting algorithms to determine whether an asset is trending up or trending down. The bot will then buy or sell the asset accordingly.

# Conclusion
These are just a few of the trading strategies employed by the ensemble trading bot. By combining these strategies and adjusting the weights assigned to each strategy based on historical performance, the bot is able to produce more accurate and reliable predictions than any single strategy on its own.
